# What is World of Warcraft 2D?
World of Warcraft 2D is a passion-project aimed to re-create Blizzard's famous MMORPG, _World of Warcraft_, in two-dimensions.

For some background, I've been playing World of Warcraft since I was in elementary school (I've mainly stuck with 3.3.5a and 1.12) and I've been toying with game development for a couple of years now. Programming is one of my favorite hobbies and my future career. I've been programming since junior high and game development, I think, is a great way to learn how to program. With that being said, I haven't yet released a game but I have built various prototypes spanning across different genres: Aukrus (a Fallout-fan game), Elements (Terraria clone), Covert (akin to Hitman [currently in progress]), Harvest (survival), all 2D.

I am fully open to contributions. I don't fully understand multi-user contributions on Github so if anyone has experience in this and how I can help set it up without messing up my local source and the master branch, please reach out to me with the contact information found below.
If you aren't one who can contribute code or art, you are more than welcome to open an issue on the repository and comment your thoughts and ideas there. You will be fully credited :)

To more closely follow development, you are welcome to visit WoW 2D's [Trello](https://trello.com/b/bSbIOhmU/world-of-warcraft-2d) page. I list my weekly goals here.

# Support
Over time, I quickly noticed a lot of positivity towards this project and my goal for it as I posted on various forums. I've seen a lot of intrigue. Between working and attending university full-time, I've very little time to work on World of Warcraft 2D. Donations are absolutely _not_ necessary, but if you'd like to make a donation of any amount to help my productivity and support development, I would deeply appreciate it.
