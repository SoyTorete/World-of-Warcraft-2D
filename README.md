# What is World of Warcraft 2D?
World of Warcraft 2D is a passion-project aimed to re-create Blizzard's famous MMORPG, _World of Warcraft_, in two-dimensions.

For some background, I've been playing World of Warcraft since I was in elementary school (I've mainly stuck with 3.3.5a and 1.12) and I've been toying with game development for a couple of years now. Programming is one of my favorite hobbies and my future career. I've been programming since junior high and game development, I think, is a great way to learn how to program. With that being said, I haven't yet released a game but I have built various prototypes spanning across different genres: Aukrus (a Fallout-fan game), Elements (Terraria clone), Covert (akin to Hitman [currently in progress]), Harvest (survival), all 2D.

# Support
Over time, I quickly noticed a lot of positivity towards this project and my goal for it as I posted on various forums. I've seen a lot of intrigue. Between working and attending university full-time, I've very little time to work on World of Warcraft 2D. Donations are absolutely _not_ necessary, but if you'd like to make a donation of any amount to help my productivity and support development, I would deeply appreciate it.
